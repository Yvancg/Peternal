## Project overview:
I'm excited to introduce "Peternal," a novel social media platform designed for pets and their owners. Developed as my final project for Harvard's CS50x 2023 course, this venture is open to angel investors interested in its potential growth.

## Current Features:
- **User-Friendly Registration:** Simple sign-up process.
- **Pet Profiles:** Add your pets with comprehensive details (photo, name, sex, breed, date of birth, tracker).
- **Pet Matching:** Find a perfect match for your pet in our "dating" section.
- **User Control:** Easily manage pet trackers, update photos, and maintain account security.

## Upcoming Enhancements:
- **Social Sharing:** Create and share posts about your pet (photos, videos, texts) with privacy controls, like a of a furry Muzzlebook.
- **Pet Tracking:** Integrate a physical tracker to monitor your pet's location via our platform.
- **Health Management:** Keep track of vaccinations, medications, and set reminders for health-related tasks.
- **Eternal Life Technology:** Using advanced technology and AI to create a lifelike, interactive avatar of your pet, ensuring a lasting bond. We'll immortalize your pet's essence by compiling all uploaded pet photos throughout their life to create an avatar that will respond to your voice commands, providing a unique way to cherish your pet's memory.

## In brief:
Peternal merges technology with pet care, offering a unique experience for pet owners. I invite you to join me on this exciting journey to revolutionize pet companionship, and make taxidermy and pet mourning a thing of the past.
